### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is mainly used to find good places in the area like malls and parks. It also helps the users to check the taxi availability and the weather condition. The web application can fit multiple screen, from mobile to desktop screen. 

The main goal of this project is about helping people to have a quick break in their lives to go out and find some good places in the area. Most people nowadays are stressed and one of the main reasons is the pandemic.

I believe this application will be a big help to those people who are stressed, depressed, not in a good mood or those who are in any negative energy.

### UI/UX

* The design main colors revolves in blue, green, red and black. I chose these colors because it represent the nature's colors, blue and green are very pleasing to the eyes, red to catch the attention, black to neutralize the colors and to make it dark so it won't stressed your eyes.
